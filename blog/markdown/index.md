quote from <<Fooled by Randomness>>:
>From the standpoint of an institution, the existence of a rick manager has less to do with actual risk reduction than it has to do with the _impression_ of risk reduction

here we have some javascript code
```javascript
function foo(){
  console.log("hello markdown!");
}
```
now comes the css
```css
.clearfix:after {
	clear: both;
	content: " ";
	display: block;
	font-size: 0;
	height: 0;
	visibility: hidden;
}

.clearfix {
	display: block;
	height: 1%;
}
```
